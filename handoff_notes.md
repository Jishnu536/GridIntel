# Handoff Notes

## What Was Completed

- **End-to-End Forecasting Pipeline**: Built a complete pipeline that forecasts next-day solar energy output using Random Forest Regression.
- **Feature Engineering**: Developed relevant weather-based predictors including GHI rolling averages, wind speed changes, humidity spikes, and irradiance ratios.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implemented evaluation using Mean Squared Error with visualizations (line and scatter plots) to compare actual vs. predicted outputs.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Integrated two anomaly detection methods:
  - Residual-based outlier detection
  - Isolation Forest for identifying feature-space anomalies
- **Alerts System**: Built alert generation system with CSV output (`alerts_table.csv`) and webhook-based integration with Zapier for automated alerts.
- **Frontend Interface**: Developed an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** with the following:
  - CSV input and upload
  - Real-time charts and predictions
  - Anomalies visualization
  - Alerts Table
  - Text-based forecast summary
- **Output Reports**: Created final CSV reports (`final_output_with_summary.csv`) and summary text file (`weekly_summary.txt`) for users.

## What Didnâ€™t Get Done (and Why)

- **Advanced Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter optimization (e.g., GridSearchCV) was not fully implemented due to time constraints. The Random Forest model uses default parameters with minimal tuning.
- **Cloud Deployment**: While the app runs locally via Streamlit, it has not been deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS). This was outside the scope of the current sprint.
- **Unit Tests**: Basic testing was done manually, but formal unit/integration tests were not added due to prioritization of core functionality.
- **Historical Alert Log Storage**: Currently, only the latest set of alerts is stored. A persistent historical alert database was considered but deferred.

## What Could Be Improved With More Time

- **Model Improvements**:
  - Extend the ML forecasting model to predict energy output for the upcoming week, enabling better mid-term planning and resource allocation.
  - Include historical and real-time market price data into the model to support cost-optimized forecasting and financial decision-making.
- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Add filtering/sorting options in Streamlit for better alert and anomaly navigation
  - Enhance authentication with role-based access
- **Monitoring & Logging**:
  - Add performance logging and tracking
  - Integrate with cloud logging services
- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy Streamlit app to cloud for easy external access
  - Introduce exportable insights, filter options, and advanced analytics directly within charts for deeper user engagement and operational flexibility.
